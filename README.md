# React Timer by Marvin Aziz

This is just a little App I created to learn how to use React Hooks.
As this is quite a helpful application for me I decided to host it on Netlify.

# Be aware of the sound!

This app is supposed to make an irritating sound as soon as the timer finishes. So be prepared!
